# Chocolate rating project
## Overview
- Analyzed a dataset of over 2300 chocolate bars' ratings scraped from http://flavorsofcacao.com/.
- Enriched the dataset with additional data about countries of bean origin and location of companies.
- Analyzed data distributions using multiple visualizations.
- Used feature engineering to encode variables such as Ingredients and Most Memorable Characteristics.
- Trained Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, SVM and CatBoost models to predict the rating of bars.
- Examined the CatBoost model to determined which features have most impact in predicting ratings.

The data was taken from http://flavorsofcacao.com/ (last update on March 14, 2020). See also <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings">this Kaggle dataset</a> for an outdated version of the same data.
